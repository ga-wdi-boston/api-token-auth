# API Token Authentication

## Introduction

Using curl and jQuery.ajax to access an authenticated API with html forms to
sign up, sign in, and sign out of an API. We'll also change our passwords. The
API uses Token authentication and we'll see how to make authenticated request
(sign out and change password).

## Prerequisites

-   jquery-ajax-*

## Objectives

By the end of this talk, developers should be able to:

-   Use `curl` to access an authenticated API.
-   Use `$.ajax` to access an authenticated API.

## Instructions

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone) this
repository.
1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Using web APIs

Why is authentication an important topic?

Web APIs often require some sort of authentication.  The game API requires users
to register and then login to gain an authentication token.

We'll use `curl`, [httpbin.org](http://httpbin.org/), and `jQuery.ajax` to
explore HTTP further. Then we'll connect to an authenticated API,
[library-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/library-api).

The operations we'll perform:

| verb   | path                   | parameters |
| ----   | ----                   | ---------- |
| POST   | `/sign-up`             | `credentials` containing `email`, `password`, `password_confirmation` |
| POST   | `/sign-in`             | `credentials` containing `email` and `password` (response contains auth data) |
| PATCH  | `/change-password/:id` | `passwords` containing `old` and `new` (requires Authorization header) |
| DELETE | `/sign-out/:id`        | None (requires Authorization header) |

### Registering with the API

#### Follow along: Use an Echo Server to Help Write Code

First we'll test our command against an [echo server](http://httpbin.org/post)
to make sure we're sending the right data. There's no need to use an actual
e-mail address and don't use anything you might want to actually use as a
password.

We'll use `scripts/sign-up[-json].sh` to run curl, first sending JSON then
sending data the way the browser does by default. We'll see how the server
treats both ways of sending data (it's all just strings) in a similar way.

If we left out the `--include` flag we wouldn't see the response header. What's
the benefit of using an echo server?

#### Code along: Write a sign-up script

Next we'll want to actually register with the API.

We'll modify `scripts/sign-up[-json].sh` to connect to the `library-api`.

#### Code along: Sign-up from our client

Now let's put code into `assests/scripts/auth/*` to get another "e-mail" address
registered with the API.  We'll again start with the echo server.

### Logging into the API

#### Code along: Write a sign-in script

Now with url encoded data in `scripts/sign-in.sh`, let's sign in to the account
we just created.

#### Lab: Sign-in from the client

Add a form to `index.html` and code to `assets/scripts/auth/*` to login to the
API. You may want to start by using the echo service to check your request.

What should we do with the data returned by the API?

### Changing the password

#### Code along: Write/Execute a change-password scripts

We'll use `scripts/change-password[-json].sh` to change a password. After that
we'll verify that we can no longer authenticate using the old password.

#### Lab: Change password from the client

Add a change password form to `index.html` and code to `assets/scripts/auth/*`
to change the password.

### Signing out

Signing out invalidates the current token.

#### Code along: Write/Execute a sign-out script

We'll use `scripts/sign-out.sh` to sign out of the API. We'll verify that the
token we used is no longer valid.

#### Lab: Sign out from the client

Add a sign out form to `index.html` and code to `assets/scripts/auth/*` to sign
out of the API.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
-   `grunt reformat`: reformats all your code in a standard style
-   `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
-   `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
